# The project

## why this project
This project is all about teaching physics and chemistry with microcontrollers.

As a physics and chemistry teacher, I have to also teach my students to create/use models and sensors applied to microcontrollers.

## the Adafruit feather M4 express 

Not satisfied with arduino board, i searched for a microtroller that suits my needs :
* Can be programmed with python (and C if I need more performance)
* Can output a true analog signal (not just pwm).
* a screen already integrated or can fit easily on top
* some integrated buttons are always useful 

And the winner is...

After some trial/errors, my best candidate is the Adafruit feather M4 express :
* lots of power and two DACs to play audio
* an oled featherwing on top for the screen and buttons
* can add a battery

## A step further

After that, I some more handy ports to make my students have a better experience with that board:
* Add an arduino like port to connect cables and teach them electricity
* Add some grove port when we are using sensors/actuators
* Add a 3.5mm jack plug to output audio easily to speakers/headphones
* Add breadboard to make circuity
* Put everything together to move it easily

## the result

The first proto looks like this :

## You want to  build one by yourself

Everything is on the github repo (see top of page)

## You want buy one already made

One manufacturer of teaching hardware in france is building this.

## Many thanks to :
A great thank to Antony Meunier, Engineering teacher in the lycée Saint éxupéry, for his help of the design of v1 of this board and his mastering in lasercut.
A Ms Ourida Smahi, Sylvie Ségui et Chantal Le Nivet, technicians in physics and chemistry, for their help in the v1 assembly.
